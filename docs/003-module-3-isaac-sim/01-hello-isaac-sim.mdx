# Hello Isaac Sim: Getting Started with Advanced Simulation

## Introduction

Welcome to Isaac Sim, NVIDIA's advanced robotics simulation platform! Isaac Sim provides photorealistic rendering, advanced physics simulation, and synthetic data generation capabilities that are essential for training AI models. In this lesson, you'll learn to set up Isaac Sim and run your first simulation with advanced rendering features.

## What is Isaac Sim?

Isaac Sim is a reference application for physically accurate simulation of robotic systems. It provides:

- **Photorealistic Rendering**: High-fidelity visual simulation using NVIDIA Omniverse
- **Advanced Physics**: Realistic multi-body dynamics and contact simulation
- **Synthetic Data Generation**: Tools for creating training data for AI models
- **USD-based Scenes**: Universal Scene Description for complex scene composition
- **AI Integration**: Built-in tools for reinforcement learning and computer vision

## Key Concepts

### Universal Scene Description (USD)
USD is the foundational format for 3D scenes in Isaac Sim:
- **Prims**: Basic scene objects that can contain other prims
- **Properties**: Attributes of prims (position, color, etc.)
- **Relationships**: Connections between prims
- **Variants**: Different versions of the same prim

### Omniverse Kit
The underlying framework that powers Isaac Sim:
- **USD Composer**: Scene creation and editing
- **Physics Engine**: PhysX for realistic physics
- **Renderer**: Kit-based rendering system
- **Extension System**: Plugin architecture for custom functionality

### Synthetic Data Generation
Tools for creating training data:
- **Camera Simulation**: Multiple camera types with realistic noise models
- **Lighting Simulation**: Physically-based lighting with global illumination
- **Sensor Simulation**: Realistic sensor models with noise and distortion
- **Annotation Tools**: 2D/3D bounding boxes, segmentation masks, etc.

## Hands-On Lab: Your First Isaac Sim Scene

Let's create a simple script to launch Isaac Sim and spawn a robot.

### Hello Isaac Sim Script

```python title="code-examples/isaac-sim-module/hello_isaac.py"
import omni
from omni.isaac.kit import SimulationApp
from omni.isaac.core import World
from omni.isaac.core.utils.stage import add_reference_to_stage
from omni.isaac.core.utils.nucleus import get_assets_root_path
from omni.isaac.core.utils.prims import get_prim_at_path
from pxr import Gf, UsdGeom
import carb

# Initialize Isaac Sim application
simulation_app = SimulationApp({"headless": False})

# Get the world instance
world = World(stage_units_in_meters=1.0)

# Add a ground plane
ground_plane_path = "/World/defaultGroundPlane"
world.scene.add_default_ground_plane(prim_path=ground_plane_path)

# Add a simple cube to the stage
stage = omni.usd.get_context().get_stage()
cube_path = "/World/Cube"
cube = UsdGeom.Cube.Define(stage, cube_path)
cube.GetSizeAttr().Set(0.2)
cube.GetPrim().GetAttribute("xformOp:translate").Set(Gf.Vec3d(0.0, 0.0, 1.0))

print("Hello Isaac Sim! Cube added to the stage.")

# Play the simulation
world.play()

# Run for a few steps
for i in range(100):
    world.step(render=True)
    if i % 20 == 0:
        print(f"Simulation step {i}")

# Stop the simulation
world.stop()

# Shutdown the application
simulation_app.close()
