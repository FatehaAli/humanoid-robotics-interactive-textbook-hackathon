# Capstone: System Architecture & Project Setup

## Introduction

Welcome to the capstone project! This is where all your learning comes together. In this module, you'll integrate everything you've learned across all previous modules into a complete autonomous humanoid system. You'll connect ROS2 communication, Gazebo simulation, Isaac Sim advanced rendering, and VLA voice control into a unified system.

## System Architecture Overview

The complete integrated system architecture:
