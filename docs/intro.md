## What This Textbook Covers

The textbook is organized into six comprehensive modules:

### 1. ROS2 Module
Learn the fundamentals of ROS2: Nodes, Topics, Services, and Python agents for humanoid control. Understand the communication backbone that enables all robotic systems to function as integrated units.

### 2. Gazebo Simulation Module
Dive into physics-based simulation, URDF models, and sensor simulation in Gazebo. Create realistic environments for testing and development.

### 3. Isaac Sim Advanced Module
Explore high-fidelity simulation with photorealistic rendering and synthetic data generation using NVIDIA Isaac Sim. Learn advanced simulation techniques for AI training.

### 4. Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Pipeline Module
Implement VLA systems using Whisper for speech recognition, LLMs for action planning, and ROS2 for execution. Build voice-controlled robots.

### 5. Capstone: Autonomous Humanoid Module
Integrate all previous modules into a complete autonomous humanoid system that combines ROS2, Gazebo, Isaac Sim, and VLA for full autonomy.

### 6. AI-Native Features Module
Implement RAG chatbots, personalization engines, Urdu translation, and Claude Code sub-agents for enhanced learning experiences.
